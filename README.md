## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I worked my pre-existing knowledge of concepts such as flex, using the hover elements and media queries. I also worked with the background and changing the image depending on the screen size.  I enjoyed adjusting the elements of the card such as the text and images, to look as similar to the image as I could.

Display of Flex - code: 

```css

.whole-box {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    width: 450px;
    height: auto;
    margin: auto;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

Despite my current understanding of media queries, there is still more for improvements as I am not that confident with using that concept. I also need to improve my knowledge of responsive websites as I struggle with changing the content when its screen size changes.
